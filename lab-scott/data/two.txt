Hello. Zuko here. But I guess you probably already know me. Sort of... Uh so, the thing is... I have a lot of Firebending experience, and I'm considered to be pretty good at it. Well, you've seen me, you, know, when I was attacking your. Uh, yeah, I guess I should apologize for that. Bu-But anyway, I'm good now. I mean, I thought I was good before, but now I realize I was bad. But anyway... I think it's time I joined your group and taught the Avatar Firebending.
